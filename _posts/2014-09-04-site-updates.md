I made some updates to this site:

* Styling has been tweaked
* Jekyll 2.3.0 is now being used
* About page text updated

The source can be checked out [here](https://github.com/hckr/hckr.github.io).

I'm still not entirely satisfied with how the pages look, but for the time being, it's good enough.

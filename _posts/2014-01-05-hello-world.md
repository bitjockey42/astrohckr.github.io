As a software engineer, I tend to relinquish writing prose in favor of code. Coding, after all, is itself a form of expression. You turn ideas into a language the computer can understand (through a series of translators, of course), and create virtual utilities seemingly out of thin air.

Writing prose or poetry is a similar endeavor, but instead of programs that run on computers, a writer's craft involves turning words into sights and sounds in the mind, into a world operating within the confines of imagination. 

I intend for this blog to be both a record of what I learn in my field, and a way to express myself in the written word rather than code. 

My words will hopefully translate to something meaningful to whoever may come across these texts, perhaps not as utilitarian as the code I produce.
